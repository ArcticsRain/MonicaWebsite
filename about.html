      <p>I’m a developer and 3D architectural visualizer with experience across coding, real-time engines, and architectural workflows.
      I enjoy working on technical problems, building interactive systems, and creating visually grounded 3D environments.
      Open to roles in software development and architectural visualization, including junior or internship positions.
      Currently focused on expanding my technical breadth and strengthening my foundations in modern development and cloud technologies.
      I value clean structure, adaptability, and learning through hands-on projects.
