      <p>I’m a technically-minded developer and 3D architectural visualizer with 
        an interest in building both functional and visually grounded digital experiences.
        I enjoy working at the intersection of logic and design — whether that’s writing clean code, 
        developing interactive systems, or creating detailed 3D environments.
        My background spans software development, real-time 3D, and architectural visualization. 
        I’m comfortable adapting to different workflows and enjoy learning new tools and technologies as part of my growth.
        Currently open to opportunities in software development, technical roles, and 3D architectural visualization, including junior, graduate, or internship positions. I value strong fundamentals, collaboration, and continuous improvement, and I’m motivated to grow within a professional team environment.
